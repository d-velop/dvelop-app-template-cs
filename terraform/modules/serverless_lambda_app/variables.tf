  # Unfortunately there is a bug in terraform which leads to the destruction of existing resources if
  # the element order of lists and maps changes cf. https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16210
  # Elements of maps are ordered alphabetically. So each element has a prefix to preserve the order.
  # This prefix is not part of the stage name and will be removed internally.
  # If you add stages use keys which result in the stage appended at the end of the list!
  # If you are uncertain use terraform plan to check the changes terraform would make.
